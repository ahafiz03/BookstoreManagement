# BookstoreManagement
This project was created as a course final project, Introduction to Computer Science II, using Java.

I created and implemented a system that allowed a bookstore owner to keep track of inventory/member details, using a set of classes and a test harness to represent the 
internal structures during execution. Additionally, I wrote and visualized a UML diagram and functionality description to analyze and communicate the process of 
creating the system.
