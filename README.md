# BookstoreManagement

## Overview
This project was created as a course final project, Introduction to Computer Science II, using Java in May 2022.

I created and implemented a system that allowed a bookstore owner to keep track of inventory/member details, using a set of classes and a test harness to represent the internal structures during execution. Additionally, I wrote and visualized a UML diagram and functionality description to analyze and communicate the process of creating the system.

## About

The Automated Bookstore System has three functions that have been implemented in the system. No matter what option you choose (other than the “Exit” option) you will have to create a member account before you choose any other option. 

The first option is to make a purchase, where you can choose from three categories: books, CDs, and DVDs, each with two books/CDs/DVDs. Once you have chosen an option, it will be added to your cart and you will not be able to choose it again as there is only one of each option. Once you are done with shopping you will be redirected to your cart with the cost of your products and the cost of both your products and a premium membership if you purchased one.

The second option is to check if you have any membership dues. If you have any dues, then the cost will be presented to you, and you will be given the option to pay them now or later. If you do not have a premium membership, you will not be presented with any dues.

The third option is to register as a new member. This option will also show up if you have not registered as a new member. You will be asked if you want a premium membership or a free membership and then you will be added to the list of members.
